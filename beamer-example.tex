\frame{
\frametitle{Project Research Group}
\begin{itemize}
\item This project is carried out within the LARCA research group at UPC .
\item Researchers within LARCA have in the last two years began
collaborations with hospital and health agencies for the analysis of electronic
healthcare records [EHR].
\item In previous work within the group, they proposed to organize the information in EHR in the form of graphs and hyper-
graphs, which can then be navigated by experts and mined with graph and
network theoretic tools.

\section{State-of-the-art in Community Detection}

\frame{
\frametitle{State-of-the-art in Community Detection}
Communities are a part of the graph that have fewer ties with the rest of the system.\\ A community should be densely connected, well separated from the rest of the network and the members of the network should be more similar among themselves than with the rest.

\section{Louvain Community Detection Algorithm}

\subsection{Louvain Method} \frame{
\frametitle{Louvain Algorithm \cite{communitypaper}}
Louvain algorithms is the state of the art community detection Algorithm. Louvain algorithm attempts to maximize modularity.
This algorithm has two phases. The diagram shows the

\frame{
\frametitle{Louvain Algorithm Pseudocode}
Louvain Algorithm Pseudocode:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repeat until local optimum is reached:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Phase1 : Split or partition the graph by optimizing modularity greedily
\item Phase2 : Agglomerate the found clusters into new nodes
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
}
\subsubsection[Phase1]{Louvain Method} 
\frame{
\frametitle{First phase in Louvain}
Louvain Algorithm Pseudocode for Phase1:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assign a different community to each node.
\item For each node $v_i$
\begin{itemize}
\item For each $v_j$ $\in$ N($v_i$),consider removing $v_i$ from community of $v_i$ and place it in the community of $v_j$
\item Choose $v_i$ into community of neighbour that
leads to highest modularity gain (Greedy Choice).
\end{itemize}
\item Repeat until no improvement can be done
\end{enumerate}
}

\subsubsection[Phase2]{Louvain Method} 
\frame{
\frametitle{Second phase in Louvain}
Louvain Algorithm Pseudocode for Phase2:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let each community $C_i$ form a new node $v_i$
\item  Let the edges between new nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$ be the sum of edges
between nodes in $C_i$ and $C_j$ in the previous graph
\end{enumerate}

}

\subsubsection[Mode of implementation]{Mode of implementation} 
\frame{
\frametitle{Mode of implementation}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The implementation of the Algorithm is in Python. pyLouvain is code that is freely available although considering the task performed by the project it is tough to use pyLouvain directly. Hence modifications were made to pyLouvain and some part of the code was reused. 

\item  The input data structure was altered. The Input file is stored in a matrix and its transpose is used to get the node set. This is  used to for a edge dictionary. 

\item  The first phase of pyLouvain is used as it is in the project and the second phase has been modified in the manner that relabelling is done.

\section{Conclusions}
\frame{
\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the project we have surveyed a few algorithms that aim in community
finding keeping in mind that the input
is taken from health care domain.
\item Louvain Community detection algorithm was chosen for community detection and for visualization. Alchemy.js were selected after considering
the input and a few state of the art algorithms.
\item The algorithms and frameworks thus found were implemented and tests
were conducted for finding the efficiency of the algorithms.
\item A GUI implementing Web.py and Bootstrap was created combining the
visualization and the computation.

	\frametitle{Challenges}
There were quite a few challenges in the project. I was from a pure theoretical background, so I had to learn all the following from scratch:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Python
\item JavaScript
\item WebFrame works - Django, web.py
\item Learning Alchemy.js and web.py
\item I had some experience in Linux, git and github
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Personal Learning}
\frame
{
	\frametitle{Personal Learning}
The project gave a huge scope for exploring many softwares and trying out several of them. It gave an opportunity for me to learn Python to depth. My interest for Data visualization and graph algorithms has increased. By trying a web application I got accustomed to using web frameworks and web technologies.
